## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at U.C. Berkeley interested in statistics and machine learning. Before coming to Berkeley, I was a student at Arizona State University, where I studied mathematics and economics, and completed master's thesis under [Sebastien Motsch](http://seb-motsch.com/) in the mathematics department. Outside of university, I was recently a research intern at Salesforce Research, and have also worked for Amazon.com in the past. See my [CV](./assets/files/Theisen_AcademicCV.pdf) for more.

## Photography

I love to travel and spend as much time outdoors as possible. I always take my camera with me wherever I go - feel free to check out some of my [photos](https://www.instagram.com/rythei).

## Research
Since coming to Berkeley, I have been primarily interested in various theoretical aspects of deep learning, though lately this has mainly been focused on the question of _generalization_. Namely, I'm interested in when and how we can fit extremely complicated and expressive models to data, and expect these models to perform well on new, unseen data. 

Below is a list of papers I've co-authored.

**Theisen, R.**, Klusowski, J. M., Wang, H., Keskar, N., Xiong, C., Socher, R. _Global Capacity Measures for Deep ReLU Networks via Path Sampling_. Submitted, 2019. [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10245)
