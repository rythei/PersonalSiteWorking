## About Me

I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley interested in statistics and machine learning, advised by [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/). I also work closely with [Jason Klusowski](https://jasonklusowski.github.io) at Princeton. Before coming to Berkeley, I was a student at Arizona State University, where I studied mathematics and economics, and completed a master's thesis under [Sebastien Motsch](http://seb-motsch.com/) in the mathematics department. I was also the machine learning lead in the [Luminosity Lab](https://theluminositylab.com). Outside of university, I spent two summers as a research intern at Salesforce Research, and have also worked for Amazon.com in the past. See my [CV](./assets/files/Theisen_AcademicCV.pdf) for more.

## Photography

I love to travel and spend as much time outdoors as possible. I always take my camera with me wherever I go - feel free to check out some of my [photos](https://www.instagram.com/rythei).

## Research
Since coming to Berkeley, I have been primarily interested in various theoretical aspects of deep learning, though lately this has mainly been focused on the question of _generalization_. Namely, I'm interested in when and how we can fit extremely complicated and expressive models to data, and expect these models to perform well on new, unseen data.

Below is a list of papers I've co-authored.
