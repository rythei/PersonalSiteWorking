## Generalization and Deep Neural Networks

### The generalization problem

The question of generalization is fundamental in statistics and machine learning. At it's core,
it is a question of _learnability_. In the machine learning setup, we generally have
some data $$ X_1,...,X_n $$, which we usually assume are all sampled independently from
some distribution $$\mathbb{P}_X$$.

Suppose we have functions

$$

f \in \mathcal{F}

$$
